                    Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the 
                    order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, 
                    often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.

                    Chickens are Earth’s most common birds. There are about seven chickens for every 
                    person living in the world! People have raised chickens for thousands of years for 
                    their meat and eggs.

                <p>
                    The bear is a symbol of strength, courage and tenacity. It also represents a gentle 
                    friendship and a docile follower in camouflage. However, bear’s love for honey adds 
                    up an amusing element into the symbol of power and dignity.

                    Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family 
                    Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, not all of 
                    which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from 
                    Eurasia and Africa.

                    For all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are family animals 
                    and truly social in their own communities. They usually live in groups of 15 or more 
                    animals called prides.
